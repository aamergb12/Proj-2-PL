Sesh 1 – Maze Representation & Planning
Reviewed the project specification and understood the maze format as a list of lists containing f, w, s, and e. Planned to implement a DFS-based backtracking solution using Prolog recursion. Decided to track visited cells to avoid infinite loops.


Sesh 2 – Maze Validation & Start Detection
Implemented valid_maze/1 to verify:
- Maze is non-empty
- Maze is rectangular
- Exactly one start space exists
- At least one exit exists

Implemented find_start/3 using nth0 to locate the start coordinates.

Sesh 3 – Movement Rules & Boundary Checks
Implemented move/5 rules for:
- left
- right
- up
- down

Created inside/3 predicate to prevent moving off the maze boundaries. Also added wall detection to block invalid movement.


Sesh 4 – Recursive Solver
Implemented solve/5 using depth-first search. The solver:
- Succeeds immediately if current cell is an exit
- Tries valid moves recursively
- Prevents revisiting previous cells
- Automatically generates the solution path when Actions is unbound


Sesh 5 – Testing & Debugging
Tested using example.pl and test.pl with randomly generated mazes using gen_map/4. Verified:
- Correct path generation
- Failure on invalid mazes
- No wall collisions
- No out-of-bounds movement
- No infinite loops

Final Notes
This project helped reinforce Prolog recursion, backtracking, unification, and DFS search strategies. The solver correctly handles bound and unbound action lists and follows all project constraints.
